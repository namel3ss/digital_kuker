### What is a Kuker?

Kuker (in Bulgarian: Кукер) is а monstrously costumed Bulgarian man, who performs traditional rituals intended to scare away evil spirits. You can read more in this [article](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/kukeri-survakari-unesco-intangible-cultural-heritage-photos) from National Geographic.

### Why digital kuker?
Same as the physical world kukeri, I am doing my best to fearlessly tackle the challenges in my daily work and scare away the evil spirits of the digital world in the form of bugs and issues.
